# Minesweeper
Remake the classic minesweeper game

Steps:

1. Implement the core logic of the Minesweeper game in C++. 
This would involve creating the grid, generating mines, calculating adjacent mine counts, handling cell selections, and managing game states (e.g., win or lose).
2. Once the game logic is complete, you can create a wrapper around your C++ code using a suitable language binding system like Node.js' C++ Addons. This allows you to expose your C++ functionality to JavaScript, which will be used by Electron.
3. Set up an Electron project and create the necessary files for the windowed interface. This typically involves creating an HTML file for the game window, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling user interactions.
4. n your JavaScript code, you can leverage the Node.js integration provided by Electron to interact with your C++ code. This allows you to call the exposed C++ functions and handle game events in your JavaScript code.
5. Implement the necessary event listeners and user interface elements in your HTML and JavaScript code to handle player interactions. This would include handling mouse clicks on the game grid, updating the display based on game state changes, and providing feedback to the player.
